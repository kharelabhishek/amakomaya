        detaildescription: "Mugu District Coordination Committee (DCC) is located in Province No. 6 of the mid-western Region of Nepal. It borders with Dolpa to east, Bajur to West, Humla and Tibbet to people of Republic of China to the North and Kalikot and Jumla to the south. Mugu lies in the high hills, the lowest elevation point is 1,201 meter and the highest elevation point is 6,717 from sea level. Mugu karnali, Humla Karnali and khatyad are the major rivers in DCC and biggest lake called Rara Tal is also located there. Due to low level of agriculture production, the majority of households face acute food shortage for large part of the year. Total population of Mugu is 55,286 according to 2011 census. Due to geographical conditions and low economic status, low literacy rate also has affected the people, children drop school after class 5 or class 8 mostly. There are some government schools providing free education and some private boarding schools, which has led parents these days to send their children to school rather than farm. Amakomaya team went there to implement Amakomaya in Kathyad VDC of Mugu district with the support from Nepal government and UNICEF funding. Every partner, stakeholders and grassroot worker has roles and responsibility to fulfill in order to implement the project and create an impact from project. Seven health post of Kathyad VDC were trained to use amakomaya, each health post includes 9 FCHVs and other health worker. Total 63 mobile sets distributed to FCHVs for data entry and showing pregnancy contents to pregnant mothers and a tablet to health post for reporting, planning and generating digital electronic data of maternal health.",

        detaildescription: "Amakomaya is connected with  Nepal wireless project started by Magsaysay award 2007 winner Mahabir Pun. Mr. Pun and his team started wireless project in 2002 that aimed to deliver information in the village of Nangi via internet through wireless connections. With the help and effort of various volunteers an information centre was set up in the village. Many computers were built in the wooden box and computer lab was set up that could connect the village to the internet. Although the project has now initiated various methods to deliver services such as communication, tele-education, you tele-health, and e-business, it did very little at the begining of the project. So, Mr. Rajendra Poudel, a member from Mahabir's team and also the vice-chairman of the project started program training to improve the access of content and services from the internet. He designed the project for highly vulnerable pregnant mother and infant babies. The women, pregnant women and mothers were requested to visit the information centre where they could access the YouTube video information about their pregnancy and caring for infant babies within a very short period of time. However, women refrained to use the services in the information centre. Women busy in their households found it difficult to invest time in the information centre as they thought that the only new generation needed these services to connect to the world. The failure to attract women to the information centres gave rise to the curiosity and determination to find innovative ways that could integrate women to the information delivery in minimum time and without having to travel hours. This was the time when feature phones had penetrated the market in Nepal. Therefore, innovative ideas including mobile phones were explored. Soon after, contents relating to pregnancy targeting the feature phones were developed and tested on mass. The women were excited to see the video and listen to contents and were willing to share and transfer the contents on their mobile phones. This acceptance of technology became a stepping stone to the present version of android application called 'Amakomaya' that delivers information to pregnant women via mobile phones. Amakomaya formally started in 2012 in Makwanpur district of Nepal. The current version of application delivers information, videos about fetal development and government services to pregnant women of rural communities who have to travel hours for information. The contents can easily be accessed offline by the pregnant mothers and Amakomaya also has a preface for health worker that allows them to track pregnant women for their ANC visits and also promote immunization registration and child tracking system in the application. The data collected by the health workers can easily be accessed by the government officials for decision making in policy level. The initiative's contribution to improving the access of information to pregnant women in vulnerable rural settings and also the emphasis and improve the access to immunization was recognized by The Global South ehealth Observatory(ODESS) for ODESS award.The global south ehealth observatory (ODESS) is an initiative of Fondation Pierre Fabre. The Fondation Pierre Fabre is a charitable organization working since 1999, is operating in 14 countries to improve the access to medicine and quality healthcare in the south. It promotes and helps ehealth initiative around the world that aims to increase and improve access to quality healthcare and medicines for the most disadvantaged populations in resource limited countries. ODESS recognizes the innovative projects that integrate health system with ICT tools to maximize and improve the coverage. This year Amakomaya was recognized by ODESS (from 71 listed initiatives), for the ehealth initiative that allows pregant women to access information about fetal development, encourages regular ANC visits in rural areas and promotes immunization to their new born. The initiative was recorded and documented by ODESS by field observation after which ODESS award was declared. Amakomaya along with 9 other ehealth initiatives from around the world have won for the ODESS Award for 2017. All the initiatives were acknowledged in an annual conference held in its headquarter France on 3rd July 2017. This conference provided all the winners including amakomaya a platform to connect to the world and also the opportunity for dialogue between probable partners.",

        detaildescription: "Relief and Health Camp for mothers, mother-to-be and elderly women. (By Amakomaya and Patan Academy of Health Science) 2015 April 25, Nepal Earthquake also known as a Gorkha Earthquake of 7.3 magnitude made a huge effect in most of the part of the country. Killed more than 8000, people, more than 16000 people are injured, and thousands of people were made homeless with entire village flattened, across many district of the country.  Katmandu Durbar Square, centuries-old buildings were destroyed in Kathmandu Valley, the Patan Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square respectively. Earthquake has not only inflicted heavy human casualty but dealt a big blow to livestock, poultry and other sectors related to agriculture as well. Many agencies and personal donor provided relief materials for the victims in the possible area which were accessible to them. Elderly people, pregnant mothers and mothers who has just given birth to their child have high risk during earthquake and the infant babies (under 5 years) as well. Pregnant mothers, infant babies and elderly people are physically and mentally weaker than others during such crisis.  Because of the fear and stress there is a huge chance of miscarriage for pregnant women (5 to 7 months) during the time of Earthquake. As Amakomaya (Mother’s Love) is working in 1 one VDC of Rasuwa and 4 VDCs of Makwanpur and 1 VDC of Chitwan district. Major focus of “Amakomaya (Mother’s Love)” program is to deliver the motivational content to save the life of Mother and infant babies. The program has distributed smart phone with installed “Amakomaya (Mother’s Love)” android apps on it to Female community health volunteers (FCHVs). During this earthquake “Amakomaya” program has given concern to the situation of pregnant mothers and their infant babies. So Amakomaya with this partner agencies Patan Acadamy of Health Science (PAHS) initiatives planned to distribute the relief materials to the pregnant mothers and their infant babies. Of Thulo Gaun and Dada Gaun of Rasuwa district.  It has become a very challenging situation for health workers to provide treatment to all the victims with insufficient medicine and equipment, as health post has collapsed and all the record file were buried and destroyed. It would not have been a problem regarding records and information f all the data were saved in internet. But amakomaya had the records saved in the server of all the pregnant women. Providing all the data to the health post and conducted health checkup camp for pregnant mothers and infant babies. With an objective of conducting ANC checkup (Ante-Natal Care) for pregnant women, PNC checkup (Post-Natal Care) for childbirth women and normal checkup for any other, team departed towards Manakamana VDC for the help they could provide. And also encouraging mothers for breast feeding.  As a relief, Amakomaya and Patan Academy of Health Science (PAHS) has provided 1.5kg of nutritious food (Sarvattam pitho) for mother or to be mother, sanitary pad and two piece of Dettol soap for mothers. May 30th 2015, Health camp was setup in Archela, two (2) wards of Thulo Gaun, one (1) ward of Manakamana VDC, all nine (9) wards of Dada Gaun VDC and three (3) wards of Thulo Gaun was covered in two days. Total 130 women came for checkup from 12 different wards. Amakomaya had collected some general information about the present situation, death of any child under 5 year within this 2 year and information about pregnancy or childbirth. Environmental sanitation, personal hygiene and safe drinking water is also one of the risky factor which may cause epidemic so amakomaya interviewed 61 women to know about such thing in affected area. In the health camp normal injuries, ANC checkup and PNC checkup or routine checkup went very well. The interesting fact discovered that among 130 women  10 of the women having problem of uterine prolapsed who were already in need of treatment and were treated immediately by Ms. Rashmi Raj upadhaya and Dr. Amit Arial from PAHS.  Women who has been hiding their problem for years were very happy to get treatment and knowledge regarding Uterine.",
